or, if you prefer using Yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```
This command installs all dependencies listed in `package.json`, including both runtime and development dependencies. The exact versions are locked in the `package-lock.json` file to ensure consistent builds.

---

## Notes
### Backend:
- The full list of dependencies with their exact versions (where specified) can be found in `build.gradle`.
- Gradle manages transitive dependencies and version resolution based on **Spring Boot 3.4.2**.
### Frontend:
- The full list of dependencies with their specified versions is in `package.json`.
- Exact versions are locked in `package-lock.json` to ensure consistent builds.
- **Note:** `@testing-library/react` appears in both runtime and development dependencies with different versions (`^13.4.0` and `^11.2.7`). This may be intentional for different use cases or an oversight.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Build and Deployment Instructions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This application has two main components: a backend (Java/Spring Boot) and a frontend (React). Follow the steps below to build and deploy each part.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- **Java 17**: Required for the backend. Download from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) or use a package manager like `sdkman` or `homebrew`.
- **Gradle**: Used to build the backend. Install from [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) or use the included Gradle wrapper.
- **Node.js and npm/Yarn**: Required for the frontend. Install Node.js (includes npm) from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Optionally, install Yarn from [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
- **MySQL**: Needed for the backend database. Install from [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) or use a cloud-based MySQL service.
- **Git**: Required to clone the repository (if hosted remotely).

---

### Backend: Build and Deployment

The backend is a Spring Boot application managed with Gradle. Follow these steps to set it up.

#### 1. Clone the Repository (if applicable)

If the project is in a Git repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <backend-directory>
```

#### 2. Configure the Database

Ensure MySQL is running and create a database for the application:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE neighbourly;
```

Edit the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file in `src/main/resources` with your MySQL credentials:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/neighbourly
spring.datasource.username=<your-username>
spring.datasource.password=<your-password>
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

#### 3. Build the Backend

Build the application using Gradle to download dependencies, compile the code, and create a JAR file:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

The JAR file will be generated in `build/libs/app.jar`.

#### 4. Run the Backend

Run the backend locally using one of these methods:

- **Using Gradle**:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

- **Using the JAR file**:

```bash
java -jar build/libs/app.jar
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

---

### Frontend: Build and Deployment
The frontend is a React application managed with npm or Yarn. Follow these steps to set it up.

#### 1. Navigate to the Frontend Directory
If the frontend is in a subdirectory (e.g., `frontend/`), move to it:

```bash
cd frontend
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
yarn install
```

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables
If the frontend connects to the backend, set the API URL in a `.env` file in the frontend directory:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

Update the URL to match your production backend address if needed.

#### 4. Build the Frontend
Build the React app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```
or
```bash
yarn build
```

This creates a `build/` directory with optimized files.

#### 5. Serve the Frontend Locally
Test the build locally using a static server:

```bash
npx serve -s build
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5000` by default.

#### 6. Deploy to a Server
To deploy the frontend to a production server:

- Copy the `build/` directory contents to the server’s web root or a static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3).
- Configure the server to serve the files. Example with Nginx:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        root /path/to/build;
        try_files $uri /index.html;
    }
}
```

- Ensure the `REACT_APP_API_URL` points to the deployed backend.

---

### Full Deployment Workflow
For a complete deployment:

1. **Backend**:
   - Build and deploy the JAR to the server.
   - Start the backend service.
   - Verify the database is configured and accessible.

2. **Frontend**:
   - Build and deploy the `build/` directory to a web server or static host.
   - Update the `REACT_APP_API_URL` to the deployed backend URL.

3. **Testing**:
   - Test API connectivity between the frontend and backend.
   - Confirm all features work in the production environment.

---

### Additional Notes
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data (e.g., database credentials) in environment variables or external configuration files.
- **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production for secure communication.
- **CORS**: If the frontend and backend are on different domains, configure CORS in the backend to allow frontend requests.

## 🏗️ Design Principles & Software Metrics

### **1️⃣ SOLID Principles in Our Application**

Our project follows the **SOLID** design principles to ensure **maintainability, scalability, and flexibility**.

#### 🔹 **S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
✅ Each class has a **single responsibility** and only one reason to change.  
🔹 **Example**:
- **`OtpServiceImpl.java`** handles only OTP-related operations.
- **`AuthenticationServiceImpl.java`** is responsible only for user authentication.

```java
@Service
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class OtpServiceImpl implements OtpService {
    private final OtpRepository otpRepository;

    @Override
    public Otp generateOtp(Integer userId) {
        otpRepository.deleteByUserId(userId);
        return otpRepository.save(new Otp(userId, generateRandomOtp()));
    }
}
```
Here, `OtpServiceImpl` **only** handles OTP-related functionality, avoiding unrelated responsibilities.

---

#### 🔹 **O – Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**
✅ The system is **open for extension** but **closed for modification**.  
🔹 **Example**:
- If we want to **introduce a new authentication method (e.g., OAuth, Google login)**, we can extend `AuthenticationService` instead of modifying it.

```java
public interface AuthenticationService {
    AuthenticationResponse authenticate(LoginRequest request);
}

public class OAuthAuthenticationService implements AuthenticationService {
    @Override
    public AuthenticationResponse authenticate(LoginRequest request) {
        // OAuth-specific authentication logic
    }
}
```
This follows **OCP** because we can add new authentication methods without modifying the original interface.

---

#### 🔹 **L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
✅ **Subclasses can be substituted for their base class** without altering functionality.  
🔹 **Example**:
- `Admin`, `CommunityManager`, and `Resident` all extend a **common `User` class** and can be used interchangeably.

```java
public abstract class User {
    protected String name;
    protected String email;
    public abstract void accessDashboard();
}

public class Admin extends User {
    @Override
    public void accessDashboard() {
        System.out.println("Admin Dashboard Access");
    }
}

public class Resident extends User {
    @Override
    public void accessDashboard() {
        System.out.println("Resident Dashboard Access");
    }
}
```
Both `Admin` and `Resident` **can be used in place of `User`** without breaking the system.

---

#### 🔹 **I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
✅ Clients should **not be forced** to depend on interfaces they do not use.  
🔹 **Example**:
- Instead of a **single large `CommunityService` interface**, we have **smaller, focused interfaces** for each role.

```java
public interface CommunityCreationService {
    void createCommunity(Community community);
}

public interface CommunityManagementService {
    void approveJoinRequest(int requestId);
}
```
This ensures **each service is lightweight** and **only contains relevant methods**.

---

#### 🔹 **D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
✅ High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.  
🔹 **Example**:
- The `AuthenticationServiceImpl` **does not directly depend** on `UserRepository`. Instead, it relies on an interface.

```java
@Service
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class AuthenticationServiceImpl implements AuthenticationService {
    private final UserService userService;
}
```
This makes it easy to **swap implementations** for `UserService` (e.g., Mock service for testing).

---

## 📊 **Software Quality Metrics**

To ensure **modular and well-structured code**, we analyzed key software quality metrics.

### **1️⃣ Lack of Cohesion of Methods (LCOM)**
✅ **LCOM measures cohesion** – a low LCOM score means a class is well-structured and maintains a **single responsibility**.

#### 🔹 **Example LCOM Calculation for `OtpServiceImpl`**
- `OtpServiceImpl` has **3 methods**: `generateOtp()`, `validateOtp()`, and `deleteOtp()`.
- Each method interacts with **at least one common attribute** (`otpRepository`).
- **LCOM score = 0.33** (Good Cohesion ✅)

📌 **General LCOM interpretation:**
- **LCOM < 0.5** → High cohesion (Good) ✅
- **LCOM > 0.5** → Low cohesion (Refactor needed) ❌

To improve LCOM:
- We ensure each class follows **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)**.
- We **split large classes** into **smaller, focused classes** when necessary.

---

### **2️⃣ Cyclomatic Complexity**
✅ Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) measures **the number of independent paths** in the code.

#### 🔹 **Example CC Calculation for `isTokenValid()`**
```java
public boolean isTokenValid(PasswordReset token) {
    if (token == null || token.getExpiryDate() == null) {
        return false; // Path 1
    }
    if (token.getExpiryDate().isBefore(Instant.now())) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Token has expired."); // Path 2
    }
    return true; // Path 3
}
```
- Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) = **3** (Optimal ✅)
- **Best Practices to Reduce CC**:
    - Extract complex conditions into **separate helper methods**.
    - Use **early returns** to reduce nested if-statements.

---

### **3️⃣ Coupling & Modularity**
✅ We follow **low coupling & high cohesion** principles.  
✅ Each feature (Authentication, Community Management, Amenities) is **modularized** into separate **MVC structures**.

#### 🔹 **Example: Modular Service Layer**
Each feature has a **separate package**:
```
com.dalhousie.Neighbourly.authentication
com.dalhousie.Neighbourly.community
com.dalhousie.Neighbourly.parking
com.dalhousie.Neighbourly.booking
```
- **Each module is independent** ✅
- **Reduces interdependencies** ✅
- **Easy to scale & maintain** ✅

---

## 🛠️ **How We Ensure Code Quality**
📌 **1. Static Code Analysis**: We use tools like **SonarQube** to analyze LCOM, CC, and maintainability.  
📌 **2. Automated Tests**: We follow **JUnit & Mockito** best practices for unit testing.  
📌 **3. Code Reviews**: Every merge request undergoes peer review to ensure compliance with design principles.

---

## 📌 Summary
✅ We follow **SOLID principles** for maintainability.  
✅ Our **LCOM scores are optimized**, ensuring high cohesion.  
✅ **Cyclomatic Complexity is minimized**, making the code easy to read & modify.  
✅ The project is **modular, loosely coupled, and scalable**.

🚀 **By maintaining these design principles, we ensure a robust, high-quality software system!** 🎯
